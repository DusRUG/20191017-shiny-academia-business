[Slides](https://github.com/DusRUG/20191017-shiny-academia-business/blob/master/20191017_RUG_shiny_development.pdf) from Praer's talk "Shiny development in an academic vs business setting"

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) is a popular R package for building interactive web apps – no web development knowledge required! Its ease-of-use and extendibility makes it popular in both academic and business settings, but implementation in the two environments can be rather different. I’ll share my experience writing shiny apps at a Max Planck Institute (a non-profit research institute) and trivago (a German hotel search engine), and how differences in task complexity, IT infrastructure and organisational mindset affected my approaches and the packages I used.

Note: I've also given [an overview of packages "shinyverse"](https://github.com/sowla/2019-MS-RUG-shiny-extensions) at the [Münster R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Munster-R-Users-Group/events/257889907/) and an [intro to shiny workshop](https://github.com/sowla/2019-shiny-intro-workshop-Nijmegen-RLadies) with [RLadies Nijmegen](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-nijmegen/events/256917758/).
